<h2> About Me  </h2>

<p>
 I have a very keen interest in computers and IT sector I have seen IT industry taking baby steps before taking over the world as a storm.I am having a mechanical engineering background. When I did my mechanical engineering in 1987  there use to be only electronic engineering and the latest computer use to be scientific calculator which we were using and thinking lucky we don't need to go through all those cumbersome calculations manually. But now every sector there is using IT in form or the other. During my mechanical engineering career I used CAD/CAM, Solidworks and SAP(CRM). I am from India and been in Australia for five years. When I cam to Australia my qualifications could not be carried over due to some surname issue, so I started form ground zero again. As I am in regional area where job prospects are not very high I decided to work in disability sector as it was inbuilt in me to help older, disadvanged and disabled people.I did my certificate IV in community services and a couple of months ago finished my diploma in communty serives from TAFE. I can read write and speak three languages English, Hindi and Punjabi proficiently. I can unstand a few words of Urdu if spoken but not very good at it.   I have experience in teaching in many asian countries like India, China, Taiwan and Thiland. I use to play basket ball when I was studying in school then started playing cricket in college and now a days I am golf in my spare time.

<h2> Interest In IT   </h2>

<p>
Our company got WeConnect(CRM) and I was given the job of system administrator. In that system for development most of the tasks can be performed by point and click whithout any coding, but that made me think that how far we far we have come in such short time span in this sector and is still growing. That made me curous to know about programming and IT sector. I was not having mych knowledge about IT sector so I contacted Open University Australia. I was having a mindset to learn coding and do a degree to be a proficient programmer. OUA repersentative listened to me carefully and guided me that RMIT is best to suit my requirements  and I enrolled myself into this course. Since I have started this course it has opened up my mind that it's not limited to only coding there are so many other aspects of IT which can be explored. Everyday i am learning something new about IT and it is increasing my depth of knowledge and interest in IT.

<h4> What I learned from these Tests </h4>

<p>

These tests have given few things which I need to work on to perform better in a team enviornment and to grow personally and professionaly. The first thing I have to work on is imagination, that's a very important thing the reason being if you are working on any project or task you have to have imagination then start making a plan, then you have to start executing to achieve your goal. The second thing is I have to be bit more excitement seeking as it's not always about work you have to have fun whenever you can. While forming a team I should be careful that others should have bit high score on these to have a right kind of balance of team.

<h2> Project Ideas  </h2>

<h4> Overview  </h4>

<p>

My project is to develop a treat despenser dogs which can be modifiied to accommodate other pets too. It  trigger a valve to dispense treat for them at certain intervals.

</p>

<h4>  Motivation  </h4>

<p>
In today's busy life most of us are out for work leaving our pets alone at home and they bored, out of this boredom sometimes especially dogs starts playing with houseold stuff that can be termed as destructive.
 </p>

<h4>  Similar technology in market at present  </h4>

<p>

While searching I found some similar stuff on the market, such as cat feeder, and laser controlled rotating type drum for feeding the dogs. my quipment will be totally different in working as I'm thinking of utilizing a relay to control the dispensing valve.

</p>

<h4> Construction  </h4>

<p>

It consists of a treat container capable of holding treats, through an app the valve will be operated and the treat will fall in the tray and dog can have it. There can be more than one equipment kept in a house and operated at different intervals so that dog's mind is busy searching treat around the house instead of destroying stuff

</p>

<h4>  Equipement Required  </h4>

<p>

For This we will need a container for holding treat, a valve for opening and  closing, a relay to shut the valave immediately after it has dispensed the treat and app/program to trigger the relay.
